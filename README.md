# exponential-sum

The expo_sum.py version uses only the sum function and no other one. On the other hand, the expo_sum2.py uses the range() function which I wasn't sure if I was allowed to use.

expo_sum2.py is more efficient than expo_sum.py.

testes_expo_sum.py provides unit tests for both functions.
